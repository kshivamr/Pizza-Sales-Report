🍕 Restaurant (Pizza) Data Analysis – SQL Project
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract valuable insights from a restaurant’s (pizza-based) dataset. The goal is to showcase my data analysis skills by generating meaningful query results that can help restaurant owners make informed business decisions.

🧠 Why I Did This Project
I created this project to:

Practice and showcase my SQL querying and problem-solving abilities

Analyze real-world restaurant data to solve business problems

Build a strong portfolio as a Data Analyst

Share my learning with others and connect with like-minded professionals

🔍 What This Project Covers
The SQL queries in this project help answer key business questions such as:

What are the top 5 most sold pizzas?

Which day and time bring the highest sales?

What is the average order size and revenue?

How are customer ratings distributed?

Inventory or ingredient usage trends (if applicable)

Each query is written, optimized, and explained for better understanding and reusability.
